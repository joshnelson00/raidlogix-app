# Django Full Stack Web App with Docker and EC2


## A full functional RAID attribute manager for product/project managers looking to stay organized and efficient

This project is a web application designed to help product and project managers efficiently organize and manage RAID (Risks, Assumptions, Issues, Dependencies) attributes across various projects. Built using Django for the backend, the application offers a streamlined interface for tracking and updating RAID logs. Docker is used to containerize the application, making it easily deployable, while AWS EC2 provides a scalable cloud environment for hosting. The goal is to provide a centralized, user-friendly platform for managing project uncertainties and dependencies in real-time. This project was created by using the following procedures:

* Developed the backend using Django by creating models, implemented views, and integrating authentication to handle user's requests
* Configured an SQLite database for local development and testing, with the option to switch to a more scalable database for production if needed
* Containerized the application with Docker by building a Dockerfile to simplify environment setup and ensure consistent deployment
* Deployed the application to an AWS EC2 instance, ensuring scalability and reliability in a cloud-hosted environment
